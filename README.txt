it did not like, so he told me to make it a nullptr

Description: This project involves creating a Super Mario Bros.-inspired simulation game. The objective is for Mario to navigate through a series of levels, collecting coins, interacting with power-ups, and battling enemies to defeat a boss and save the princess.

The world consists of multiple levels (L) represented by NxN grids, with Mario starting at power level 0 and a set number of lives (V). He can increase his power by collecting mushrooms and earn extra lives by collecting coins or defeating enemies. Mario must defeat regular enemies like Goombas and Koopas, as well as a level boss to advance. The final goal is to defeat the last boss and win the game.

The program reads a plain text file for world specifications (level count, grid size, and enemy/item distribution) and logs each of Marioâ€™s moves and interactions, tracking his progress through the simulation. The game ends when Mario either wins by defeating the final boss or loses by running out of lives.
